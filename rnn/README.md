## RNN

This code used RNN (Recurrent neural network) and LSTM (Long Short-term memory) to achieve classification based on ['MNIST dataset'](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
To learn more detail, you can watch the video from ['MorvanZhou'](https://morvanzhou.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning/tensorflow/5-03-A-CNN/)


[rnn.py](https://github.com/lym0302/tensorflow_learning/blob/master/rnn/rnn_regression.py) is a classification example.
[rnn_regression.py](https://github.com/lym0302/tensorflow_learning/blob/master/rnn/rnn_regression.py) is a regressive example.


## The result of rnn_regression

The red solid line is the true curve and the blue dotted line is the predict curve.
